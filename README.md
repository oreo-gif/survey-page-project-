# survey-page-project

this is the solution to the survey page project which is the 2nd challenge project by FreeCodeCamp in the Web developement Certification

this challenge had to be completed using HTML5 and CSS

I tried making a survey form for vegetable sale and people's review on the current scenario

It had to include various form elements like:
1) Radio
2) Dropdown menu
3) Text box
4) Number input (with min max)
5) Checkbox
6) Submit button
7) Email input

I have added background image, hover effect and various fonts to make it more attractive and so that I could explore more of them. I have marked various sections of the code using comments so that it is easy to understand
